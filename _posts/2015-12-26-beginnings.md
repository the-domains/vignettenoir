The unlikely beginning of Vignette Noir starts
with a native German from Berlin. I moved to the US. Against all odds he ends
up in the City of Buffalo. Berlin, the city he was born and grew up in
celebrated its roughness and cheap attitude towards life, felt like the polar
opposite of everything the image of the US suggested. The former Berlin mayor once
said "Berlin is poor, but sexy!" --Klaus Wowereit while for him the US was Bush,
War, Hollywood, Fox News and the occasional blonde twenty-something that asked "Why
is America the greatest country in the world?" followed by him rolling his
eyes. And yet, curiosity in people's stories is something he is been attracted
to ever since he left his parents' house with sixteen. He lived in Japan, tried
to figure out how businesses work at University, worked for an HIV support
center, in a smoothie bar in the UK, for the biggest European LGBT pride in
Berlin. All the while he just happened to listen to people's stories. One time
a guy told him his story of why he split with his partner of ten years over
breakfast in Berlin. Another time a customer told him about the happy life
swans lead over the counter of a smoothie bar in Birmingham, UK. Apparently,
Swans are protected and taken care of by her royal highness, the queen,
herself. Two years ago, he left Berlin to study Arts Management at the
University at Buffalo. He says there is something that pulls me out of Berlin,
the place I was just trained to call Heimat, a German word with no English equivalent.
Wikipedia suggests: "\[Heimat\] denotes the relationship of a human being
toward a certain spatial social unit." If you'd ask him, he most certainly
rejects this emotionally stripped version of the word. Looking through his
phone, he finds a recent definition he wrote for his friends: "The place we
call home, the people we call home, the place where our fond memories are and
the feeling that comes with all that. To me it is all that which gives me a
warm and fuzzy feeling deep inside." Heimat is a concept he has struggled with coming
to Buffalo until he realized that the way he made a place Heimat was by talking
to people and listen to their stories. In bars, coffee shops, art galleries,
concerts, on the street and at work. "The stories and lives that people share
are the one thing that connect people no matter through which medium they are
told." Storytelling has existed since men started to speak to each other. "I
imagine the first men after a day of hunting and gathering. They just sat
around a campfire and shared stories of their day and cracked some jokes while
at it."
