The unlikely beginning of Vignette Noir starts
with a native German from Berlin. - Two years ago, I left Berlin to live in Buffalo. I always felt that there was something that pulled me away from Berlin, the place I used call Heimat. It turns out stories are what made something a home for me and luckily I could take those anywhere I wanted.

Heimat is a German
word with no English equivalent. It's a feeling connected to people and place. I tried to explain the concept to my friends recently and kept the conversation in my messenger: 'Heimat is the place we call home, the
people we call home, the place where fond memories are and the feeling that
comes with all that. To me it is all that which gives me a warm and fuzzy
feeling deep inside.' 

When I was
sixteen I hated people. I was bullied quite a bit back then and as a result I
enjoyed when people left me alone. I used to wear those pants that I had grown
out of for a while but couldn't afford to have new ones, more importantly, though,
I did enjoy wearing them because they showed off my ankles which I found super
sexy. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/225433f3-68dd-4e1f-9e15-3d0fec86fc4d.jpg)

The kids didn't quite agree back then. In addition to that, I wore those
roundly shaped glasses with blue, long, rubber temples. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/03e40511-747a-464b-ab29-d77ecee3cbf5.jpg)

Needless to say, these deviations from the norm were perfect for kids to make fun of. So I didn't really like people. Until I
moved to Japan for a year and everybody was interested in this strange
foreigner and the stories he had to tell. A guy that was so different from them
and had grown up on the other side of the world was just very interesting and
exotic. On the other hand, I thought their stories were new and fascinating. I started to
take interest in people, especially those who were very different from myself. I
just happened to listen to people's sad and happy stories. One story that stuck
with me was a guy telling me how he split with his partner of ten years over
breakfast in Berlin. One day he got hospitalized without any warning his organs
had started to shut down. The doctors told him he was HIV+ and his immune
system was practically gone since it was left untreated. He survived, barely.
It turned out, his boyfriend knew he was HIV+, took medication but didn't think
it was necessary to tell his partner about his condition. Another time a
customer at the smoothie bar told me about the happy lives swans led. Apparently,
Swans are protected and taken care of by her royal highness, the queen,
herself. Never cross a swan, he told me. Sad or happy I enjoyed to hear those stories.

Sometimes I picture the
first men to sit around a camp fire after a day of hunting and gathering. They would
just share stories of their day and crack some jokes while at it. A need to hear new stories is the thing that pulls me away from Berlin and they are the reason I can call Buffalo Heimat. Stories are Heimat.
